# The Idealists Collective

Website for a collective of philosophers, artists, and technologists building toward utopia.

## Jazz Coded

This website is jazz coded by the collective. What does that mean?

Jazz musicians don't plan every note — they improvise, respond to each other, and create something that couldn't exist without that specific group of people in that moment. We build this website the same way.

**The rules:**

- Anyone can make whatever changes they want
- You don't need to ask for permission
- You don't need to feel bad about deleting what someone else has done (their code is saved in their commits and they can always re-add it)
- Write clean code and docs to make it easy for others to develop. Refactor other people's code when it is badly organised.
- The website should be in a constant state of flux and growth — why not change the colours just for the sake of it
