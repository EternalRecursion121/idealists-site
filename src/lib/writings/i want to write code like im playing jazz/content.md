at a jazz bar:
how many musicians does it take to play jazz?
it can start as any number of musicians, but during the peak of the performance when you *feel* it, i believe what remains of those many musicians is this one abstract collective being- for there is only one song that is playing.

some principles:
1. do musicians speak out loud to themselves to verbalise what music they want to play? 

not all art cannot be communicated through words alone- and so why do we assume this of code which is the digital fabric of this expansive digital world.
