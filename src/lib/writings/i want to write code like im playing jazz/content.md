at a jazz bar:
how many musicians does it take to play jazz?
one common canvas but many distinct jazz musicians and instruments and styles and preferences
how do you merge these into a coherent musical artifact on the fly? how can jazz sound so good because of the improvisation between the musical minds of many, without them planning it all out meticulously beforehand and not suffer from the chaos but thrive on it?

what would it be like if software was built like jazz?
a collective improvisation where the direction of creation is a symphony of ideas that layer and enrichen each other iteratively vs being planned top down
software that feels more whimsical and rich- an end result that is unpredictable and surprising yet utilises efficiently the unique skillset of its creators and becomes something that couldn't have existed without this unique set of people?
software that feels like it has been ingrained with the soul and intent and thought process of the people who created it.

some principles: / questions?
1. do musicians speak out loud to themselves and each other to verbalise what music they want to play? 

not all creation and collaboration can be done via being communicated through words alone- and so why do we assume this of code which is the digital fabric of this expansive digital world.
