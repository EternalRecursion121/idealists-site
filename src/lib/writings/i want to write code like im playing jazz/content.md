at a jazz bar:
how many musicians does it take to play jazz?
it can start as any number of musicians, but during the peak of the performance when you *feel* it, i believe what remains of those many musicians has merged into a single collective entity- for there is only one song that is playing.

over the past couple of months we've been experimenting with the question, what happens when you write software like you're playing jazz?

some principles:
1. do musicians speak out loud to themselves to verbalise what music they want to play? 

not all art cannot be communicated through words alone. jazz musicians implicitly communicate their intentions through the flow of the music they play. and the musicians around them adapt to whatever changes are thrown in. in the same way, jazz coding does not come with a set of instructions for what you are going to build, or discussion about what to do. people throw their creativity in, and it is up to others to feel the flow of where they are trying to go.

2. have fun

jazz coded software is not built with utility in mind. there is no set purpose or goal to your creations. there are no metrics by which you will be judged. it is software created for its own sake.
