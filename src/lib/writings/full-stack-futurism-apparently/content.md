I was confused for a while why I seemed to be getting more distant from EA/rationality, which raised me (2021-25). I reached around for 'post-rationality, but…energetic, constructive, still active in the world'?

This is linked to 'San Francisco, not Berkeley': I am a starry-eyed San Franciscan; I don't know how much I have in common with Berkeley. The open-plan transparency-pilled shipping/sharing-first freethinking offices of Mox over the marginally more insular Constellation.

This is linked to liking the output of FHI/Forethought best among the 'EA orgs'. To understanding arguments about 'the optimal timing for superintelligence {development, deployment}', Aschenbrenner and Trammell, Drexler's Paretotopia, 'slower not necessarily better', and perceiving AI safety people who assume 'AI safety = slower' like alien kin.

Anders Sandberg's 'full-stack futurism' very appealing. [Execution](https://lydianottingham.substack.com/p/there-are-two-types-of-work), implementation important. TESCREAL made sense for a while. EA was my first brush with prioritization, one component of the 'full stack'.
