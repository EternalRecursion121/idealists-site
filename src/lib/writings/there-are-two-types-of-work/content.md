I think the distinction between 'action' and 'commentary' is important and native to me. And I don't think it's native to all my friends—some of whom are going to work in evals, forecasting, and journalism.

Not all evals are 'commentary'. Evals to catch schemers are very much 'action'. You're proactively anticipating failure modes and designing safeguards to counter them. This is honorable!

But evals like the [METR Time-Horizon Benchmark](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) or [CAIS's RLI](https://www.remotelabor.ai/), journalism like [Reboot](https://joinreboot.org/), and forecasting like [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) are forms of 'commentary'. They ask "what's new, what's likely?" And the audience throws peanuts as your commentary crashes into reality. Importantly, many evals don't tell us much we don't already know, or that wouldn't be obvious to a system user.

There are many ways to act. We need some groups raising as many concerns as they can, some groups working as fast as they can to address them. Some people allocating scarce funds, others converting them into differential technological progress. Generator-discriminator, challenge-answer.

These kinds of work are not 'commentary' but 'action':

1. Robustness, interpretability, training research
2. Policy research and advocacy
3. Disseminating calls to action
4. Bringing beneficial products to market
5. Ops in support of the above
6. …

There are ways to make commentary more action-like. If your commentary is coupled with a call to action—even a private one—that crosses into action. If there's an org handling the 'call to action' that _actually_ relies on and values your output, that counts. But you do need to check that that holds.

If all the commentary disappeared overnight, I don't think I'd miss it. I may blog on the side but sincerely enjoin: steer clear of the chattering classes.

#### FAQ

**Q: What's the distinction between action and commentary?**

**A:**

I think my distinction between 'action' and 'commentary' is demarcated by:

1. Is your audience diffuse or specific?
2. Is your ultimate intent to persuade\* or to inform/entertain?

Specific, concrete, named audience + _intent to persuade_ := action

Diffuse audience + intent to _inform/entertain_ := commentary

\*conditional on that being the right thing to do. i.e. making recommendations / sending out a call to action, with the understanding rebuttals may come
