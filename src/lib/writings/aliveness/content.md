'Aliveness' is a concept that I use often, though I'm still not quite sure what I mean. Here is an attempt to sketch it out more fully.

Aliveness requires movement not stasis, it requires openness to growth. It requires seeing reality as it is, and taking part in it fully, not dissociated from it. It requires caring about things.

Zizek says that he does not fear death, he fears undeath.

As life becomes more and more frictionless, we turn into zombies, taking the path of least resistance without ever having to think for ourselves.

Things that are alive:
- Children playing
- Sapling

Things that are dead:
- Rocks
- Paperclip maximisers
- Dead people

Things that are undead:
- instagram reels
- slop
- leaves blown by the wind
