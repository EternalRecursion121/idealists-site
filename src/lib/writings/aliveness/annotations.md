## "Maybe, by being part of the Idealists Collective (maybe just in spirit, so far), YOU have timelessly discovered there is a future set of highly alive and awesome entities becoming real through unfolding mediated by (among others) YOU. Maybe you can Get Real, and become some of those awesome future entities, by Idealistically Ideating (and creating) the Ideal into existence. Creating tech for staying-and-becoming real-and-alive is crucial for avoiding unalive dystopias."

It seems to me, though, that sometimes being eaten is a good thing that provides a lot of purpose? See: how people describe falling in love; how people describe Big Projects... etc and it's unclear to me when this is good vs bad. And I don't think "the thing that's eating you is alive" is a good enough criterion to mean being eaten by that thing is necessarily good.
